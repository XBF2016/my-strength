## **1\. Relator**

**RELATIONSHIP BUILDING**

### **HOW YOU CAN THRIVE**

You enjoy close relationships with others. You find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.

### **WHY YOUR RELATOR IS UNIQUE**

*These Strengths Insights are personalized based on your CliftonStrengths results.*

Because of your strengths, you do not see yourself as the life of the party. While some people love large and noisy, you prefer small and intimate.

Instinctively, you have a small group of friends who remain constant even when you haven't seen or talked to them for a while. Whether a week, a month or a year goes by, your relationships are rekindled the moment you reconnect with those special friends.

It's very likely that you are not interested in idle chit-chat. When gatherings are small, conversations are real. You want your interactions to matter.

Chances are good that you are a well-read individual. People whom you have befriended turn to you for guidance. Often you help them see a situation or problem from a different perspective because of something you discovered while surveying a book, article, letter, or Internet site. For you, reading is the key that opens the door to a world of fresh ideas. You collect them, never knowing when something you read will benefit someone else.

Driven by your talents, you have a special place in your heart for the times you spend with good friends. Whether frequent or seldom, those interactions are when you build the memories that reinforce your long-lasting friendships and help them continue to grow.

### **WHY YOU SUCCEED USING RELATOR**

You naturally form genuine and mutually rewarding one-on-one relationships. Your authenticity allows you to build close, long-lasting connections that foster trust and confidence.

### **TAKE ACTION TO MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL**

*Connect deeply with the right people to gain friends for life.*

* Try to get one-on-one time with people, rather than attempting to connect with them in a group. This will help you build the deeper and trusting relationships you value most.  
* Stay in contact with your friends, no matter how busy you are. Your closest relationships energize you.  
* Make sure people know that you are more interested in their character and personality than in their status or job title. You might serve as a model for others.  
* Let your caring show. For example, find someone to mentor, help your coworkers get to know one another better or deepen your existing relationships.  
* Look for workplaces, classes, teams or groups that encourage friendships. You prefer a casual style and culture and will likely not do well in overly formal situations.

### **WATCH OUT FOR BLIND SPOTS**

* Because Relators typically do not trust others implicitly and people have to earn your trust over time, some may think you are hard to get to know. Be aware of this perception with new people you meet as well as with the people you see every day.  
* Your tendency to spend more time with the people you know best might give the impression that you are exclusive or unfriendly to those outside your inner circle. Consider that you might be missing out on the benefits of widening the circle and getting to know more people.

## **2\. Harmony**

**RELATIONSHIP BUILDING**

### **HOW YOU CAN THRIVE**

You look for consensus. You don't enjoy conflict; rather, you seek areas of agreement.

### **WHY YOUR HARMONY IS UNIQUE**

*These Strengths Insights are personalized based on your CliftonStrengths results.*

Because of your strengths, you perform today's tasks and meet today's challenges today. Because you refrain from putting things off, your own and others' lives automatically become easier. No time, energy, or brainpower is wasted quarreling, fussing, fuming, or blaming. By doing what is practical and feasible right now, you probably create a sense of calm and a spirit of cooperation within individuals or groups.

Instinctively, you frequently count on specialists to help you arrive at the correct solution, decision, or conclusion. Whenever you choose to work alone on an assignment, you still turn to people with expertise for direction.

It's very likely that you love when people work together well. You naturally reduce stress and friction by finding consensus. You feel great when you can resolve conflict and move forward.

Driven by your talents, you are thrilled when people acknowledge your practical, realistic, and straightforward thinking style. They rely on you to deal evenhandedly with everyone involved in a project. They know you can keep misunderstandings to a minimum. You feel very good about life when you help your teammates, coworkers, classmates, friends, or family members behave civilly and work cooperatively with one another.

Chances are good that you accept the ongoing challenge of equalizing the amount of time you spend on key parts of your life. For practical reasons, you do not want any one thing to consume every minute of your day. Thus, you choose to handle personal and professional problems logically. You deal with facts unemotionally. You intentionally minimize conflict between people by not taking sides. Instead, you make them aware of things as they actually are. You emphasize what they have in common. Patiently, you move adversaries toward peaceable solutions and general agreement.

### **WHY YOU SUCCEED USING HARMONY**

You are naturally practical and prefer emotional balance. You can prevent arguments before they start by quickly helping others find common ground and a resolution.

### **TAKE ACTION TO MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL**

*Help others find common ground through practical solutions.*

* Build a network of people with different perspectives whom you can rely on when you need expertise. Your openness to other viewpoints will help you learn.  
* Increase unity by increasing the number of voices. When people are arguing, ask others to share their thoughts. You are more likely to find areas where all parties can agree when you have more perspectives.  
* Polish your talents by taking a conflict-resolution course. The skills and knowledge you gain will combine with your talents to create a strength in handling conflicts.  
* Avoid roles, situations and environments that require you to confront people every day. For example, making sales based on cold calls or highly competitive classes or workplaces will likely frustrate and upset you.  
* Emphasize the value of reaching consensus when you work with others. Help them see the practical side of things. This is often the starting point of agreement.

### **WATCH OUT FOR BLIND SPOTS**

* In your desire to move conversations toward practical and common-sense decisions, you may frustrate those who want to share broader ideas and opinions. Allow others to express their ideas fully before bringing them back to the task at hand.  
* You may instinctively downplay confrontational situations and try to suppress others from openly airing their ideas and emotions. Recognize and accept that there will be times when conflict is inevitable and that some people will revel in it.

## **3\. Competition**

**INFLUENCING**

### **HOW YOU CAN THRIVE**

You measure your progress against the performance of others. You strive to win first place and revel in contests.

### **WHY YOUR COMPETITION IS UNIQUE**

*These Strengths Insights are personalized based on your CliftonStrengths results.*

Because of your strengths, you normally evaluate your current results in light of your past accomplishments. You intentionally vie for first place when comparisons are made between your solo performances and those of other individuals. Whenever your talent, knowledge, or skills are being judged, you certainly relish knowing the victory is yours alone.

Chances are good that you notice that multiple solutions to nagging problems automatically pop into your mind. You usually study each option from many different angles. After carefully evaluating the entire situation, you likely choose the alternative that makes the most sense. Why? You habitually aim to outscore or outperform most of your rivals most of the time.

Driven by your talents, you concentrate much harder on your work or studies when a deadline looms over you. Knowing the clock is ticking generally forces you to ignore fascinating distractions. Time restrictions compel you to think of nothing but capturing the top prize. Your need to be the first person to finish increases during the final week, day, hour, or minutes of a project or a contest.

It's very likely that you feel much more favorable about your life each time you win a contest or a tournament.

By nature, you strive to finish first. You are determined to be the best. This explains why you are so eager to compare your individual results to those of teammates, classmates, peers, newcomers, or even strangers.

### **WHY YOU SUCCEED USING COMPETITION**

You motivate yourself and others to a higher standard of performance. You can raise a group's achievement level by creating a culture of winning and aspiring to be the best.

### **TAKE ACTION TO MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL**

*Aim for first place so you'll always finish strong.*

* Create daily measures of success for yourself and the teams you are on. Learn what it takes to win consistently.  
* List the performance scores that help you know where you stand every day. Decide which ones you should pay attention to.  
* Take the time to celebrate your wins. In your world, there is no victory without celebration.  
* Select tasks, roles and work environments where you can measure your achievements. You might never be able to discover how good you can be without keeping score.  
* Explain to your coworkers, friends and family that you enjoy battling against good, strong competitors and winning \- not from putting others down.

### **WATCH OUT FOR BLIND SPOTS**

* Be careful not to let your competitive spirit get in the way of your relationships. Not everyone has your drive to win, and constantly comparing your performance to theirs might offend them or hurt their feelings.  
* Winning at all costs isn't winning; it's self-defeating. Make sure you maintain your principles when you push yourself toward ultimate victory.

## **4\. Restorative™**

**EXECUTING**

### **HOW YOU CAN THRIVE**

You are adept at dealing with problems. You are good at figuring out what is wrong and resolving it.

### **WHY YOUR RESTORATIVE IS UNIQUE**

*These Strengths Insights are personalized based on your CliftonStrengths results.*

Chances are good that you might take a long and hard look at yourself from time to time. Perhaps you review what you have and have not accomplished. Maybe you scrutinize \- that is, give close attention to \- how you treated certain individuals and how they responded to you. Occasionally you consider reordering your personal or professional priorities. Periodically you examine many aspects of your life.

Instinctively, you concentrate much time and energy on eradicating \- that is, doing away with \- your limitations. When you conquer a shortcoming, you probably feel very optimistic about yourself and life in general.

By nature, you frequently point out issues, problems, or obstacles before others see them. You probably have been labeled a pessimist. You commonly reply, "I'm just being realistic. I choose to fix things before they wear out, break down, or become obsolete."

Driven by your talents, you may enjoy reading certain kinds of self-improvement books, publications, or Internet sites. Perhaps tips, exercises, suggestions, questions, or resource lists momentarily capture your interest when the topic aligns with your needs. Using some of the information you collect, you might concentrate your mental or physical energy on doing specific things better than you ever have in the past.

It's very likely that you regularly look for ways to enhance your speaking talents. Why? You really want people to hear what you are thinking or feeling.

### **WHY YOU SUCCEED USING RESTORATIVE**

You love to solve problems. Your ability to analyze a situation, identify potential shortcomings and modify as needed makes you powerful in times of difficulty and crisis.

### **TAKE ACTION TO MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL**

*Remember that every problem has a solution. Find the answers.*

* Look for roles in which your success depends on your ability to solve problems. You might particularly enjoy medicine, consulting, computer programming or customer service.  
* Seek out tough turnaround situations that others might avoid. You will enjoy the challenge of revitalizing something, and you will build your reputation as a valuable partner.  
* Celebrate your successes. Difficult problems might entice you, but also acknowledge easy-to-solve issues that have big results.  
* Tell others that you enjoy fixing problems, and offer to help. Many people shy away from difficulties, but problem-solving comes naturally to you.  
* Give yourself a break. You might be overly self-critical and your own toughest critic. Try to redirect your energy toward things about yourself that you know you can fix or toward external, tangible problems.

### **WATCH OUT FOR BLIND SPOTS**

* Others might think that all you see are their flaws and shortcomings. Remember that there are times when people need you to see their successes and give them praise.  
* You tend to focus on processes, not people, and you might automatically rush to solve every problem. Sometimes others need to solve their own problems, so try to give people space to experiment and find their own solutions.

## **5\. Deliberative**

**EXECUTING**

### **HOW YOU CAN THRIVE**

You are best described by the serious care you take in making decisions or choices. You anticipate obstacles.

### **WHY YOUR DELIBERATIVE IS UNIQUE**

*These Strengths Insights are personalized based on your CliftonStrengths results.*

By nature, you offer verbal feedback and positive reinforcement that is equal in measure to people's accomplishments. Even though you praise sparingly, your words echo in the minds and hearts of recipients. When you compliment individuals, they have no doubt they are truly worthy of recognition.

It's very likely that you choose your friends with care and caution. Like you, these individuals have a reputation for honoring their commitments. Like you, they do exactly what they say they will do. Your most enduring friendships are built on a foundation of mutual trust.

Chances are good that you exercise good judgment and common sense when congratulating someone. Your comments tend to be sparing. They carry a great deal of weight, however. People generally value your praise. These individuals are apt to grow personally and professionally because you call attention to their moments of excellence. They understand that any recognition you give them is hard won.

Because of your strengths, you are mindful of the events unfolding around you. Some decisions may demand urgency, but impatience does not supersede your need for caution. You are thoughtful and vigilant and will not speak before you are ready.

Instinctively, you see caution as a sensible habit. You are careful in your everyday life because you know caution prevents mistakes and leads to more thoughtful decisions.

### **WHY YOU SUCCEED USING DELIBERATIVE**

You are thorough and conscientious. Through your natural anticipation and careful thought process, you know how to reduce risks and prevent problems from arising.

### **TAKE ACTION TO MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL**

*Stop, listen and assess before taking action.*

* Rely on your good judgment, caution and conservative decision-making during times of change. Your ability to identify and reduce risk is a powerful advantage.  
* Be sure to set aside time for yourself. Try this: Reserve 20 minutes each day to sort through your projects, plans and ideas. Use this time to gather information on options, assess different situations or solidify choices you need to make. When you have the opportunity and freedom to calculate, you will make better decisions.  
* Help others think through what they want to do. Whatever your role is, you can become a valuable sounding board because you identify and assess potential risks that others might not see.  
* Be ready to explain your careful decision-making process. Others might misread your Deliberative talents as tentativeness or fear of action.  
* Don't let anyone push you into revealing too much about yourself too soon. You naturally build friendships slowly, so take pride in your small circle of good friends.

### **WATCH OUT FOR BLIND SPOTS**

* Because you take time to think carefully before making a decision, people might perceive you as forgetful, slow or afraid to act. Be prepared to explain that you are none of those things and that you are just considering all of the potential next steps.  
* Your cautious and serious outlook on life might give the impression that you are a distant, private and unapproachable person who doesn't give much praise. Keep this in mind, especially when the important people in your life need your approval and validation.

## **6\. Empathy**

**RELATIONSHIP BUILDING**

### **HOW YOU CAN THRIVE**

You can sense other people's feelings by imagining yourself in others' lives or situations.

### **WHY YOU SUCCEED USING EMPATHY**

You have great emotional depth. Your awareness of the expression, value and implications of others' emotions makes them feel like you understand them.

### **TAKE ACTION TO MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL**

*Appreciate and refine your gift for understanding others' thoughts and feelings.*

* Create a list of great questions that help others describe their emotions and experiences. Experiment using these questions with friends. Refine your list by keeping the questions that best help others express their thoughts and feelings.  
* Practice refining the words you use to name your own feelings as well as those you observe in others. Try this: Journal your emotions for one week. Stop throughout the day to capture what you are feeling. Try to use different words to describe your experience each time.  
* Be sure to decompress at the end of each day. Develop a routine that allows you to unwind and relax. If you don't, at times, the depth of your emotions might overwhelm or drain you.

### **WATCH OUT FOR BLIND SPOTS**

* Pay attention to your energy levels. Constantly experiencing others' emotions can be draining, so try to occasionally disconnect from all the emotions so you don't get burned out.  
* Because you are so sensitive to others' emotions, some people might think you are prying or overinvolved in their lives. Be careful not to overstep when others prefer to keep their feelings to themselves.

## **7\. Significance**

**INFLUENCING**

### **HOW YOU CAN THRIVE**

You want to make a big impact. You are independent and prioritize projects based on how much influence they will have on your organization or people around you.

### **WHY YOU SUCCEED USING SIGNIFICANCE**

You want to do important work and are determined to make a difference. You want others to respect you for your significant contribution and willingness to work hard to achieve success.

### **TAKE ACTION TO MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL**

*Look for opportunities to do important work where you can help others raise the bar.*

* Imagine the legacy you want to leave. Picture yourself in the future. When you look back on your life, what will you have done to make the world a better place?  
* Make a list of the goals, achievements and qualifications you want to accomplish, and put them where you will see them every day. Use this list to inspire yourself.  
* Tell the important people in your life how valuable their feedback and support are to you. You need appreciation and affirmation, and their words can motivate you.

### **WATCH OUT FOR BLIND SPOTS**

* Because of your strong Significance talents, people might perceive you as overly concerned about your reputation and success. Acknowledge that you will need to earn the respect of others through your actions and contributions.  
* Sometimes you might mask your vulnerability or come across as overly controlled, and this can make it difficult for others to know how to support you. Consider the value of making others feel important by letting them know when you need help.

## **8\. Adaptability**

**RELATIONSHIP BUILDING**

### **HOW YOU CAN THRIVE**

You prefer to go with the flow. You tend to be a "now" person who takes things as they come and who discovers the future one day at a time.

### **WHY YOU SUCCEED USING ADAPTABILITY**

You are flexible and can quickly adjust to changing or unexpected circumstances that upset or intimidate others. Your calm response to chaos reassures others and helps you respond to what people need.

### **TAKE ACTION TO MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL**

*React immediately, and be a positive force for change.*

* Look for opportunities to respond to people and situations that need your attention. Your natural ability to adapt relieves pressure during stressful situations and calms coworkers and friends.  
* Fine-tune how you respond to the unexpected. For example, if your job requires you to travel on short notice, learn how to pack and leave in 30 minutes. If your workload is unpredictable, practice the first three moves you will make when the pressure hits.  
* Don't apologize for your spontaneity. Your willingness to seize the moment means that you won't miss out on valuable experiences and opportunities.

### **WATCH OUT FOR BLIND SPOTS**

* You're so willing to live in the moment that you might constantly shift your priorities. Be aware that frequent changes can feel endless and often unnecessary to those who thrive on structure and stability.  
* You may have a tendency to miss deadlines or run late for appointments. Make sure you keep track of the most important due dates and meetings.

## **9\. Developer**

**RELATIONSHIP BUILDING**

### **HOW YOU CAN THRIVE**

You recognize and cultivate the potential in others. You spot the signs of each small improvement and derive satisfaction from evidence of progress.

### **WHY YOU SUCCEED USING DEVELOPER**

You see the raw potential in people and even small signs of progress as you actively invest in their development. Your encouragement helps others learn, grow and improve.

### **TAKE ACTION TO MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL**

*Recognize and cultivate the potential in others.*

* Make a list of people you would like to coach or mentor \- people whose potential, signs of growth and strengths you have noticed. Offer to meet with them regularly, even if only for a few minutes, to discuss their goals and strengths.  
* Call, text or email people who need your encouragement the most. Your natural ability to nurture and inspire might be just what they need to hear.  
* Try not to spend all your time encouraging people who are consistently struggling in their role. Sometimes the best developmental action is to help them find a different role that fits.

### **WATCH OUT FOR BLIND SPOTS**

* You may become overinvested in someone's development and feel personally responsible if they are struggling. Accept that sometimes, the best option is for them to find their own path forward.  
* Be careful not to devote so much time to other people that you forget to invest in your own development. Remember that you can't help others if you don't take time to work on yourself.

## **10\. Learner**

**STRATEGIC THINKING**

### **HOW YOU CAN THRIVE**

You have a great desire to learn and want to continuously improve. The process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites you.

### **WHY YOU SUCCEED USING LEARNER**

You love to learn, and you intuitively know how you learn best. Your natural ability to pick up and absorb information quickly and to challenge yourself to continually learn more keeps you on the cutting edge.

### **TAKE ACTION TO MAXIMIZE YOUR POTENTIAL**

*Use your passion for learning to add value to your own and others' lives.*

* Become an early adopter of new technology, and keep your coworkers, friends and family informed. You learn quickly, and others will appreciate when you share and explain cutting-edge developments to them.  
* Respect your desire to learn. Take advantage of educational opportunities in your community or at work. Discipline yourself to sign up for at least one new course or class each year.  
* Find opportunities to expand your knowledge. Take on increasingly difficult topics, courses or projects. You love the challenge of a steep learning curve, so beware of learning plateaus.

### **WATCH OUT FOR BLIND SPOTS**

* You place a high value on learning and studying, and you may tend to impose this value on others. Be sure to respect others' motivations, and resist pushing them toward learning for learning's sake.  
* You love the process of learning so much that the outcome might not matter to you. Be careful not to let the process of knowledge acquisition get in the way of your results and productivity.

Your greatest opportunity to reach your full potential is developing and using your strongest CliftonStrengths. But it is also important to understand all 34 of your CliftonStrengths themes.

### **Your unique CliftonStrengths 34 profile**

The themes toward the top of your CliftonStrengths 34 profile might show up regularly in your life, and the ones closer to the bottom might not show up at all.

To fully understand your talent DNA, consider how all your CliftonStrengths themes, separately or in combination, influence your work and personal life. In addition to concentrating on your top 10 themes:

* **Navigate the middle.** You might notice these CliftonStrengths themes in your behaviors from time to time. And you may need to rely on them in certain situations. Think of these themes as a support system you can use when you need to.  
* **Manage the bottom.** Just as your top CliftonStrengths show you who you are, those at the bottom may tell you who you are not. They aren't necessarily weaknesses, but they are your least powerful themes. If you don't manage them properly, they could prevent you from maximizing your potential.  
* **Identify weaknesses.** To determine if any themes are getting in your way, review the "What Is a Weakness?" section on the next page, and find out how to overcome potential obstacles to your success.

To learn more about your entire CliftonStrengths profile, see the "Your CliftonStrengths 34 Theme Sequence" section at the end of the report.

## **What Is a Weakness?**

1. Relator

34. Includer

Focusing on your CliftonStrengths doesn't mean you can ignore your weaknesses.

**Gallup defines a weakness as anything that gets in the way of your success.**

While the CliftonStrengths assessment does not mathematically quantify weaknesses, you can use your profile to understand how any of your CliftonStrengths themes might prevent you from maximizing your potential.

Your strongest CliftonStrengths are your best opportunity for success. But in some situations and with some people, these same themes can hinder your effectiveness and become blind spots.

The themes at the bottom of your profile can also get in the way of your success. They aren't necessarily weaknesses, but they likely do not come naturally to you.

To identify potential weaknesses, ask yourself:

* Does this theme ever undermine my success?  
* Have I ever received negative feedback related to this theme?  
* Does my role require me to use this theme, but I feel drained when I do?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, you may be discovering areas of weakness. Don't ignore your weaknesses. Instead, focus on your strengths, and work to manage the areas that get in your way.

**How do I manage my weaknesses?**

* **Claim them:** Know your weaknesses and how they get in your way  
* **Collaborate:** Ask partners for support  
* **Apply a strength:** Use a different theme to achieve a better outcome  
* **Just do it:** Lean in and do your best

## **Identify Your Unique Contribution: The CliftonStrengths Domains**

While your CliftonStrengths 34 profile helps you understand who you are, there is also power in knowing how you make things happen, influence others, build relationships and process information. The framework of the four CliftonStrengths domains \- Executing, Influencing, Relationship Building and Strategic Thinking \- is another way to think about your CliftonStrengths and how you contribute when you join, create or lead a team.

The best teams are made up of individuals who understand their own and others' unique contribution to the team. This awareness and appreciation empowers the team to be more cohesive, versatile, productive and engaged.

However, be careful not to let the four domains limit your thinking. If you don't have any top themes in a particular domain, don't worry. That doesn't mean you can't think strategically or build relationships, for example. Everyone accomplishes tasks, influences others, builds relationships and processes information. You just use your stronger themes in different domains to get to the same outcome.

The next page shows you how your unique CliftonStrengths profile sorts into the four domains. Knowing which domain you lead with can help you understand your most powerful contribution.

### **The CliftonStrengths Domains**

EXECUTING  
People with dominant Executing themes make things happen.  
INFLUENCING  
People with dominant Influencing themes take charge, speak up and make sure others are heard.  
RELATIONSHIP BUILDING  
People with dominant Relationship Building themes build strong relationships that hold a team together and make it greater than the sum of its parts.  
STRATEGIC THINKING  
People with dominant Strategic Thinking themes absorb and analyze information that informs better decisions.
